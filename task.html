        <p style="text-align: justify;">A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a
            visual guide that represents
            the skeletal framework of a website. The term wireframe is taken from other fields that use a skeletal
            framework to represent 3 dimensional shape and volume.<br>
            The aim of a wireframe is to provide a visual understanding of a page early in a project to get stakeholder
            and project team approval before the creative phase gets underway. Wireframes can also be used to create the
            global and secondary navigation to ensure the terminology and structure used for the site meets user
            expectations.
